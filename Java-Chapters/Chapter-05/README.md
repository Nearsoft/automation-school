# Chapter 05 - Control Statements


Control Statements

A programming language uses control statements to cause the flow of execution to advance
and branch based on changes to the state of a program. Javaâ€™s program control statements
can be put into the following categories: selection, iteration, and jump. 

1. Selection statements: Allow your program to choose different paths of execution based upon the outcome of an
2. expression or the state of a variable. 
3. Iteration statements: Enable program execution to repeat one or more statements. 
Jump statements: Allow your program to execute in a nonlinear fashion.
